# hedge-scripts
Repository of scripts for extending Hedge for Mac.

Use at your own discretion. Donâ€™t be foolish, but test before using a script in production. Scripting is a very powerful feature, it can be potentially destructive. Do not use it unless you really know what you can and can't do with scripts. The Sync Factory, creator of Hedge for Mac, does not assume responsibility for problems with or due to these scripts. The Sync Factory reserves the right not to offer support for these scripts.
